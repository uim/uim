Release manual for uim
======================

As of this moment, uim has three types of release of the same version.  They
are alpha, beta and final. Alpha may be an unstable release and it may be
untested. After the alpha release, any new big features may not be committed.

The beta release must be tested partially by the maintainer. In the ideal case
it will be well-tested by the maintainer. If a first beta (beta1) is too
unstable, a second beta (beta2) should be released to ensure the quality of
the final release. After beta release, new features may not be committed.

The final release is really the final release. It must be tested well.

For each release the following steps should be followed. To make the final
release, you have to repeat the following procedure at least three times.

1. Declare 'I will make a new release' to the mailing list.

   Committers must not add a new unstable feature if a new release has been
   announced.

2. Gather up details of the release from each committer.

   The ChangeLog of uim is very long, so making a release note from the
   ChangeLog is hard work. Therefore a committer should send details of their
   commit. Maybe we sould prepare a better way.

3. Update NEWS and RELNOTE

4. Increment the version numbers in:

   - configure.ac
   - uim.h

   And increment libtool-version.mk too if ABI is updated.

5. Export a fresh tree from the Git repository.

   $ git clone https://code.google.com/p/uim/

6. Do a build test with make-dist.sh

   This test is not enough, but worth doing. It is especially useful when a
   new file is added. We should also do unit testing at this point.

7. Tag to tags/uim-x.y.z

   On an alpha release, create a branch at first.

   $ git branch x.y
   $ git push origin x.y

   Then tag and push the tag.

   On an alpha release
   $ git tag uim-x.y.z-alpha
   $ git push --tags

   On a beta release
   $ git tag uim-x.y.z-beta
   $ git push --tags

   On a final release
   $ git tag uim-x.y.z
   $ git push --tags

8. Create the source tarball

   On an alpha or a beta release
   $ make distcheck distdir=uim-x.y.z-alpha
   $ make sum distdir=uim-x.y.z-alpha

   $ make distcheck distdir=uim-x.y.z-beta
   $ make sum distdir=uim-x.y.z-beta

9. Copy the source tarball to the download site.

   Upload the file by the official uploading script:

     http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/ScriptedUploads

   Don't forget adding appropriate tags as follows.

   Final release:

     $ googlecode-upload.py -u yamakenz -p uim \
                            -s 'uim 1.5.0' -l 'Stable,Featured' \
                            uim-1.5.0.tar.bz2

   Alpha or beta release:

     $ googlecode-upload.py -u yamakenz -p uim \
                            -s 'uim 1.5.0-alpha' -l 'Unstable' \
                            uim-1.5.0-alpha.tar.bz2

   Snapshot release:

     $ googlecode-upload.py -u yamakenz -p uim \
                            -s 'uim trunk-snapshot20070703' -l 'Snapshot' \
                            uim-trunk-snapshot20070703.tar.bz2

   And untag 'Featured' from previous final release files by the web
   interface.

10. Update the web pages.

   http://code.google.com/p/uim/
   http://code.google.com/p/uim/wiki/FrontPage

   Update FrontPage first and copy it into the project description
   (homepage).

   <obsolete>
   The checksums of the files must not directly be written into the
   anyone-rewritable wikipage, to prevent spoofings. It should be a link to the
   release announce which contain the checksum information.

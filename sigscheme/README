Please report us if you find a problem. And if you have a time, run
'make-report.sh' and send us the result regardless of PASSed or FAILed. It
greatly helps the development, especially for non-PC platforms.

How to build
------------

At first, you need to run ./configure with some options at the top directory.

  $ ./configure [--enable-conf=CONF] [--enable-default-encoding=ENCODING]

(1) --enable-conf=CONF

  This specifies a base configuration set. Select one from the list below
  suitable for your purpose.

    - full:    compile with full features but broken ones
    - regular: (default) compile with typically needed features
    - small:   compile with primary features only
    - r5rs:    compile with strict R5RS conformances
    - siod:    emulate some SIOD features and bugs
    - dev:     developer-friendly configuration
    - uim:     configure for uim

(2) --enable-default-encoding=ENCODING

  SigScheme normally selects UTF-8 as default encoding. You can change it by
  this option as follows.

    $ ./configure --enable-default-encoding=eucjp

  Following encodings can be specified.

    - utf8
    - euccn
    - eucjp
    - euckr
    - sjis

(3) --enable-ENCODING

  In addition to (2), you can enable other optional and switchable character
  encodings.

    $ ./configure --enable-default-encoding=eucjp --enable-eucjp --enable-sjis


Then type 'make' at the top directory.

  $ make


Test
----

  $ make check


Installation
------------

  $ make install


How to use
----------

To run SigScheme in interactive mode, type as follows.

  $ sscm

To execute a Scheme script, specify it as argument.

  $ sscm <filename>

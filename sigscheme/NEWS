Overview of changes from 0.6.1 to 0.7.0
==

* New features

  - "internal definitions" and "strict toplevel definitions validation"
    features have been configurable

  - Add optional duplicate variable check to 'let', 'let*', 'letrec' and 'do'
    (it is not required by R5RS)

  - [R6RS] R6RS (R5.91RS) compatible 'fixnum-width' procedure

  - SSCM_VERSION_REQUIRE() macro

  - The Cutter-based C testing framework has been replaced with the new
    framework developed by Jun Inoue. Simply type 'make check' to run the
    tests. All of old contents of test-c/ have been removed, and test-c2/ has
    been renamed to test-c/. Be careful to read old logs.

* Specification changes

  - [R5RS] Remove 'delay' and 'force' (temporarily) since they completely
    violates R5RS definitions

  - [R5RS] Proper tail recursion conformance of 'eval' has been marked as
    'uncertain'

  - [SRFI-23] Display error message and optional objects as same as the
    reference implementation of SRFI-23

  - [SRFI-34] Add 'current handler' to error object to behave as same as the
    reference implementation of SRFI-34 'raise'

  - [SRFI-77, R6RS] The SRFI-77 procedures 'least-fixnum' and 'greatest-fixnum'
    have been upgraded to R6RS (R5.91RS) (nothing is actually changed)

  - Definition of dotted list length is changed to SRFI-1's from
    SigScheme-speciific one. SCM_LISTLEN_DOTTED(), SCM_DOTTED_LISTP() and other
    dotted list-related macros and functions have been changed so

  - Remove initial hyphen support for symbols (such as '-sym). Use
    (string->symbol "-sym") instead

  - Remove SIOD-compatible external representation of eof value '(eof)'

  - (scm_set_lib_path): Change to holding copied library path string

  - (scm_return_value): Removed

  - Change the low-level port API to fix the design error about error handling
    (get_byte() and peek_byte() were not able to detect read error)

  - Withdraw sigscheme-stdint.h. Use scmint.h instead

* Fixes

  [R5RS] and [SRFI-n] tags indicate specification conformance fixes.

  - Fix crashes by broken va_list passing of format.c on x86_64 platform

  - Fix potential SEGV on long string parsing

  - Fix possible crash on parsing R5RS-reserved chars |[]{}

  - Fix broken GC on systems that have 8-byte aligned malloc(3) such as Cygwin

    conversion once after the error has occurred

  - Fix possible crash on parsing script prelude that only has
    "#! /usr/bin/env"

  - Fix a broken error handling on character encoding switching when
    !SCM_USE_MULTIBYTE_CHAR

  - Fix infinite loop on raising error objects that contain circular list when
    SCM_USE_HYGIENIC_MACRO

  - Fix broken ScmBaseCharPort inheritance of ScmSingleByteCharPort
    which may cause SEGV

    expressions intermixed on 'let', 'let*', 'letrec' and function form
    'define'

  - [R5RS] Fix syntactic keyword to value evaluation that only bound to syntax
    or macro (i.e. (eq? if and) has been invalidated). But binding syntactic
    keywords to first-class objects such as (define else 3) and (define do 4)
    are still allowed

  - [R5RS] Fix first-class binding objects acceptance of let-syntax,
    letrec-syntax and define-syntax

  - [R5RS] Fix invalid no-expressions <body> acceptance of 'let', 'let*',
    'letrec' and function form 'define'

  - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of binding syntactic keyword as value on
    'define', 'let', 'let*', 'letrec' and 'do'

  - [R5RS] Fix broken per-iteration env isolation of 'do'

  - [R5RS] Fix proper tail recursion incapability of '=>' form of 'cond'

    defined in R5RS

  - [R5RS] Fix improper list acceptance on single-arg map

  - [R5RS] Fix improper tail recursion of call-with-values on a corner case

  - [R5RS] Fix broken improper tail handling of 'list-ref'

  - [R5RS] Fix improper list acceptance of 'reverse'

  - [R5RS] Reject invalid number strings such as "0xa" and " 1" on
    'string->number'

  - [R5RS] Reject invalid number literals such as "#x0xa"

  - [SRFI-38] Fix inacceptance of optional 'optarg' argument of
    'write-with-shared-structure'

  - [SRFI-48] Fix optional port argument inacceptance of 'pretty-print'

  - [SRFI-48] Fix broken number prefix acceptance such as "~,f", "~1,f", "~,1f"

  - [SRFI-60] Fix invalid result of (logand). Now it returns -1 as same
    as the reference implementation

  - Fix incomplete singlebyte charater support

  - Fix broken sign extention for 8-bit char on string port read

  - Fix compile error on environments that lacks stdint.h -compatible
    definitions

  - Fix missized-cast of 'quotient' which results a broken value on 64-bit
    configurations

  - Fix 64-bit capability of quasiquoted vectors

  - Fix passing circular list into error object when SRFI-38 is not enabled

    storage-compact

    one char lesser than maximum

  - Fix crashes on 'make check' in test-c2/ on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

  - Fix unwanted test-c2/*-coll.c removal on --disable-maintainer-mode
